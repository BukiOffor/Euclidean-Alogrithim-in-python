An element a ∈ Z has a multiplicative inverse a−1 if and only if gcd(a,m) = 1, where gcd is the greatest common divisor , i.e., the largest integer that divides both numbers a and m. The fact that two numbers have a gcd of 1 is of great importance in number theory, and there is a special name for it: if gcd(a, m) = 1, then a and m are said to be relatively prime or coprime.
